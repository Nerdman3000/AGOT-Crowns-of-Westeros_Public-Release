# AGOT Crowns of Westeros - Public Release
 The public non-Steam Branch version of Crowns of Westeros.

## IMPORTANT NOTE: YOU MUST HAVE THE AGOT SUBMOD CORE INSTALLED FROM NOW ON IN ORDER FOR THE MOD TO WORK, AND FOR CROWNS TO SHOW UP IN THE BARBERSHOP AND ON CHARACTER PORTRAITS. IT MUST BE PLACED ABOVE THIS MOD IN THE LOAD ORDER.

## Description

**AGOT - Crowns of Westeros** is a submod of Crusader Kings 3 that adds dozens of new original crowns to A Game of Thrones CK3 Mod. Note that the mod is not save game compatible to saves made prior to installing the mod. You will need a fresh save for the mod to fully work. All added crowns have artifacts and exist for both genders. Certain crowns will exist during the startdate while others can be created via a decision or found via event.

A few older crowns have been integrated into the main AGOT mod, and have thus been removed from this submod. 

This mod also integrates AGOT - More Backgrounds submod. If you wish to use it standalone, you can get it here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3104698013

A game rule has been added to choose whether unique noncanon crowns show up dynamically on their respective characters. The crowns will remain in the barbershop and will still be craftable regardless.
